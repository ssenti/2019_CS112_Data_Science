# CS112: Data Science class at [Minerva](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jul/30/the-future-of-education-or-just-hype-the-rise-of-minerva-the-worlds-most-selective-university)

Taught by Professor [Alexis Diamond, Ph.D.](https://www.minerva.kgi.edu/people/alexis-diamond-phd/)

"The course focused primarily on applying statistical inference and formal models of decision making to design practical solutions. We framed
and quantified a range of scenarios to address real problems in the life sciences, energy and technology industries.
We also discovered how to make big strategic decisions with math, statistics and simulation."
